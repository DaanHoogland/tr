# tr.rs

## Description

This is a learning project for me to learn rust basics with the rust guide, implementing [tr(1) using only the man page](http://man.cat-v.org/unix_8th/1/tr)

What ever has been learned from it was contributed to the [redox-os/coreutils](https://github.com/redox-os/coreutils/). This remains only as a memory.
